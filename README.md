### About Project

This project is an another flavor of the original Garage-UI available [here](https://github.com/mrrosoff/Garage-UI). This Garage-UI is the Mountain Edition. It allows users to see the current/forecasted weather, ski conditions, total snowfall, and show live feeds from a ski resort of their choice, all at a glance. Currently, this project does ***not*** open or close a garage door.

This project is an Electron app that runs on a Raspberry Pi. The app is designed to be used with a 10"/12" touch screen. For a suggested list of hardware for this project visit this link.

This will install the dependencies, build the app, and change your Raspberry Pi to auto update itself and auto launch to Garage-UI-Mountatin-Edition. ⚠️ ***Make sure to run the script in the Garage-UI-Mountatin-Edition directory.***
