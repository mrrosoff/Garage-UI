# Snow-UI

### A Custom UI For Skiing/Snowboard Conditions

## About Project

This project is a custom UI for snow reports and conditions for a specific ski-resort. Specifically, the default is for Steamboat Springs, Colorado. The UI displays the current snow conditions, current weather conditions, and the forecast for the next 5 days. The UI also displays statistics for the resort, such as the total accumilation of snow in the past 30 days and the status of trails and lifts.
